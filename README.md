Digital transformation, automation and AI are all data-driven. Open data is a trendy concept in data economy.
It presents businesses with a huge opportunity to use half of the world's data to make better decisions.
Open data also poses a huge challenge as it is often raw, messy, complex, not analyzable, not consumable...
The world needs capable data analysts who can go out there hunting for data, make data available and easy to consume.
From the data vendor's perspective, making data publicly accessible helps generate inbound traffic and improve user loyalty.
The value proposition is not about data itself. It's about curation, availability and usability of data.
It goes from needing data to having data in seconds. On the other hand, data consumers can leverage open data and combine it with internal data to generate insights and create values for the economy. In this course, you will use data found on Government of Canada Open Data Portal and apply most practical tools and techniques to make open data consumable, visualize trends and patterns,
and present conclusions and recommendations to general public.
