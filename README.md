Digital transformation, automation and AI are all data-driven. Open data is a trendy concept in data economy.
It presents businesses with a huge opportunity to use half of the world's data to make better decisions.
Open data also poses a huge challenge as it is often raw, messy, complex, not analyzable, not consumable...
The world needs capable data analysts who can go out there hunting for data, make data available and easy to consume.
From the data vendor's perspective, making data publicly accessible helps generate inbound traffic and improve user loyalty.
The value proposition is not about data itself. It's about curation, availability and usability of data.
It goes from needing data to having data in seconds. On the other hand, data consumers can leverage open data and combine it with internal data to generate insights and create values for the economy. In this course, you will use data found on Government of Canada Open Data Portal and apply most practical tools and techniques to make open data consumable, visualize trends and patterns,
and present conclusions and recommendations to general public.

## CASE STUDY: Titanic dataset analysis
### Background
On April 10, 1912 the RMS Titanic left Southhampton, England headed for New York. Aboard were 2,435 passengers and 892 crew members. Five days later, about 20 minutes before midnight, the Titanic hit an iceberg in the frigid waters about 375 miles south of New Foundland. Within approximately two and a half hours the ship had split apart and sunk, leaving just over 700 survivors.

 ### Notes about the Dataset     
Pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

Age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

SibSp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

Parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.

### QUESTIONS the analysis wants to answer
- Did passenger class made any difference to his survival?
- Which gender had more survival?
- Person travelling with others had more survival possibility?
- Which age group had better chance of survival?
- What was male and female survival per class and by age?
